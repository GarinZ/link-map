> Profession Browser Tab Manager for Chrome and Edge

## 💡 What is Link Map?
Link Map is a browser tab sidebar that is designed for heavy information consumers.  
With Link Map, even if you have a large number of tabs and windows, you can manage and classify them in a logical and clear way using the tree view structure, forming your own link collection.

## :sparkles: Features

- 🌲 Tree-shaped vertical tab sidebar, but with more levels: you can use drag-and-drop to quickly complete more tab operations
- 💾 Close and save for later reading: clear your workspace and focus on current work, they will remain in the list
- 🔒 Backup/restore: backup and restore your data in a universal format (JSON) 🔧 TabOutliner import: supports importing data from TabOutliner and is currently supporting more import formats
- 📶 No internet connection required: all content is locally stored, ensuring the security of your information.
